# hello-world
Getting started with Github. Excited! and creating my first repository with the traditional name hello-world

Here I am making some changes to my readme file from master branch. The branch is a complete snapshot of the master branch from the time it was made. When I am making my changes here the master branch is not affected which is an important feature of Git and that is source code integrity in my words. As soon as I am finished making changes I will move to the next step which is commiting the code and giving a pull request.
